Hi Shashi,

I'd like to compliment one of your employees, Rohit Singh, for the excellent service he provided me in the last one and a half month. Rohit helped me to sort out my issues in Personal Loan Application which were caused due other banks late notifications. After I discovered that there had been several issues with my loan account which i was unaware of, Rohit helped me with the solution to clear all these issues which were wrongly raised due to my home branch's mistake.

I have been pleased with the service I receive at your branch. However, Rohit's professionalism and ability to get to the bottom of the situation quickly exceeded my expectations.

Within a few days, he helped to sort the process of having my Loan Account issues corrected.

Such a commitment to great customer service is to be commended. You can be sure that I will continue to do banking with HSBC for days to come and same refer this to my colligues.

Sincerely,
Hiralal manmode
